My name is Kenneth Steimel and I am a student at the University of Indiana. I am studying Computational Linguistics with a concentration in Corpera in Bantu languages for my PhD

I am working on learning Swahili and I knew German well at one point but that has been a few years.

I also work as a student editor at the LINGUIST List. This organization is the central source for information in the linguistics community. We have information about job postings, conferences in the field, books relevant to linguistics and much more. I edit conferences and Queries in addition to several smaller areas.<br>
