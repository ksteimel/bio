title: How to get rid of snaps from the  ubuntu store
layout: default

---

## Problem: I didn't want snaps to be the default method of install on ubuntu or fedora
- There's no way to specify a ranking system with the gnome-software program (e.g. if vlc is available in the  ubuntu repos and as a snap, install using apt not snap)
  - If anyone does know how to specify this kind of ranking, please let me know by [emailing me](mailto:ksteimel@iu.edu) or messaging me on mastodon.

## Solution: Disable the linking package between gnome-software and snapd
- In fedora:
`sudo dnf remove gnome-software-snap`
- In ubuntu:
`sudo apt purge gnome-software-plugin-snap`
